# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are five design principles for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust software. SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/1-single-responsability-principle.md)
2. [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](/2-open-closed-principle.md)
3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](/3-liskov-substitution-principle.md)
4. [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](/4-interface-segregation-principle.md)
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](/5-dependency-inversion-principle.md)

These principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin and have since become widely adopted in the software development industry. Adhering to the SOLID principles helps to ensure that code is flexible, easy to maintain, and less prone to bugs.

Each of the SOLID principles addresses a different aspect of software design, from the responsibility of individual classes to the relationships between classes. By following these principles, developers can write software that is easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
